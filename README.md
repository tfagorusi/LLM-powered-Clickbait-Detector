# LLM-powered-Clickbait-Detector
This project aims to develop and deploy a clickbait detection system leveraging cutting-edge NLP models and prompting techniques. `Comet ML` was used for  was used for experiment managenment and model versioning, prompt logging, tracking and debugging our prompts and results.
We considering three prompting techniques:
- Zero-shot: This technique provides the model with the infomation that tells it what task to perform but with no examples.
- Few-shot: This approach involves feeding the LLM model high quality examples to steer its response more effectively.
- Chain-of-Thought: In this approach, we guide the model through series of logical steps.
